                    <p><strong>Boss Bebeh Bistro Café</strong> is a cozy neighborhood spot owned by a couple. They offer great food, private function rooms for events, and fun karaoke spaces for groups. When they reached out, their goal was to attract more bookings for their event packages and build more buzz around their party trays — especially for birthdays, team gatherings, and small celebrations.

                    <p>To help with that, I launched a series of Facebook ad campaigns that focused on what made the café special: a place to eat, sing, and celebrate with people you love. We created separate ad sets for their function/event packages, karaoke rooms, and food trays, each tailored to reach the right audience in their area.
                    </p>

                    <p>The results were exciting. The campaigns generated around 600 messages per month from people inquiring about bookings, food packages, and availability. Most importantly, the business saw an <strong>800% return on investment</strong> — a huge win for a local brand investing in digital marketing for the first time.</p>

                    <p>Outside of the ad campaigns, I also designed and built their website to give them a stronger online presence. It made it easier for customers to browse their offers, view menus, and send inquiries.</p>

                    <p>I also helped manage their social media pages, including posting content regularly and creating engaging Reels that showcased their food, events, and fun karaoke moments. This helped keep their audience engaged and attracted new customers even beyond paid ads.</p>

                    <p>On top of that, I worked on some of their graphic design needs — from creating a refreshed menu layout to designing marketing materials like posters and social banners for both online and offline promotions.</p>

                    <p>Here are some of the works I did and a quick sneak peek at the project. From campaign strategy and ad creatives to website design, content creation, and graphic design, this was a hands-on project I’m really proud of — and a great example of how digital marketing can help small businesses thrive.</p>

                    <p>When <strong>Mariland Lending</strong> reached out, their goal was clear: they wanted to grow their visibility and trust among a niche market—Cebuano DepEd teachers and local vendors. These were people who valued familiarity, personal connection, and clarity when it came to financial services. The challenge was figuring out how to reach them in a way that felt genuine and approachable.

                    <p>This was actually my third project with Mr. Roland Villaraso, the CEO of Mariland Lending Corp., MCIAGroup Inc., and IBS Software Development Corp. He had been very satisfied with my previous work, so he brought me in again to help guide the branding and digital strategy for Mariland Lending.
                    </p>

                    <p>To start things off, I joined a full-day discovery session with Mr. Roland and his team. That session gave me a clear picture of the business’s values, their audience, and the role lending plays in everyday Cebuano life. It helped me shape a plan that was grounded in their reality—not just marketing trends.</p>

                    <p>For the branding, I focused on the core ideas we discussed during discovery: rock-solid service and helping our local friends in need. While their existing logo had a good foundation, I felt it could speak more to the community with the addition of a logomark. I created three logomark options that complemented the current lettermark. After a round of feedback, the team chose the final version that best reflected trust, stability, and warmth.</p>

                    <p>Knowing that social media plays a massive role in how people in the Philippines consume information, I also included social media marketing in the project. I crafted content in the local dialect and designed visuals that felt familiar to the audience—making sure everything was aligned with their culture and tone.</p>

                    <p>I also built a brand-new website for Mariland. It was content-rich but clean and simple, helping potential clients understand their services clearly. I included a step-by-step, user-friendly loan application form that made it easy even for first-time borrowers to navigate and submit.</p>

                    <p>In just a few weeks, Mariland Lending went from being a quiet local name to a growing digital presence trusted by Cebuano teachers and vendors.</p>

                <div class="modal-description">
                    <p>When I first sat down with Mr. Giovanni Jay Fuentes, a real estate agent based in Cebu, he had one clear goal in mind: generate serious leads and close real sales using only social media — and on a tight budget. With so many developers and agents online, standing out in Cebu’s highly competitive real estate space was a real challenge.</p>

                    <p>Over coffee and a two-hour chat, I got a real sense of how Mr. Fuentes operates — how he talks to clients, what kind of properties he offers, and what makes his approach different. That conversation gave me the insight I needed to shape a strategy that didn’t just push ads but told stories that connected with the right buyers.
                    </p>

                    <p>After two days of research and brainstorming, I built a campaign plan designed to generate interest, build trust, and move people from curious to converted — even with just a ₱5,000 ad budget.</p>

                    <img src="/includes/images/real-estate-strategy.webp" style="width: 100%"/>

                    <br />

                    <h3>Designing for Two Audiences</h3>
                    <br />
                    <p>Mr. Fuentes provided access to two of his existing Facebook pages: <strong>Cebu Future Home</strong> and <strong>Cebu Brilliant Houses</strong>. To appeal to both <strong>Class A</strong> and <strong>Class B</strong> buyers, I developed two completely different <strong>visual branding directions</strong>:</p>

                    <img src="/includes/images/real-estate-2-designs.webp" style="width: 100%"/>
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <p><strong>Cebu Brilliant Houses</strong> took on a premium, high-class aesthetic — sleek, clean, and perfect for luxury buyers.</p>
                    
                    <img src="/includes/images/cebu-brilliant-house-brand-1.webp" style="width: 100%"/>
                    <img src="/includes/images/cebu-brilliant-house-brand-2.webp" style="width: 100%"/>
                    <img src="/includes/images/cebu-brilliant-house-brand-3.webp" style="width: 100%"/>
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <p><strong>Cebu Future Home</strong> embraced a warm, Filipino-inspired feel, reflecting traditional values, hospitality, and ideal for growing families looking for practical homes.</p>

                    <img src="/includes/images/cebu-future-homes-brand-1.webp" style="width: 100%"/>

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <p>By tailoring the tone, look, and messaging of each page to its specific audience, I was able to speak directly to what each buyer segment cared about most.</p>

                    <h3>The Results</h3>
                    <br />

                    <p>Once the visual branding was finalized, I launched the campaigns on both pages and carefully applied the ad strategy. The content felt relatable, the messaging was clear, and the audience targeting hit the mark.</p>

                    <p><strong>With just ₱5,000 in ad spend, we generated over ₱6 million in property sales in just one month.</strong></p>

                    <p>This case study proves that you don’t need a massive budget to get massive results — just a clear strategy, good design, and an understanding of who you’re talking to.</p>

                    <p><strong>MCIAGroup, Inc.</strong> has been serving Filipino families for over 11 years with heartfelt, affordable memorial services. But until recently, their marketing relied solely on traditional word-of-mouth and offline methods. That’s when they reached out to me—to help <strong>modernize their approach and build a strong digital presence</strong> that could match the quality of their service.</p>

                    <p>After an insightful discovery session with <strong>Mr. Roland Villaraso</strong>, the company president, I gained a clear picture of what makes MCIAGroup unique: their compassion, their affordability, and their deep-rooted commitment to helping families. From there, I developed a full digital strategy designed to amplify those values online.
                    </p>

                    <img src="/includes/images/mcia-strategy.webp" style="width: 100%"/>
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <p>I started by creating a <strong>conversion-focused website</strong> that helps users easily understand the benefits of their memorial plans, complete with a smooth, step-by-step application form for non-members. I also designed a <strong>new visual branding concept centered on the theme of “Life”—using natural elements, soft greens, and organic shapes that reflect peace, growth, and comfort.</strong></p>

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <p>For social media, I led a campaign that spoke directly to their audience’s needs. I broke it down by quarter with specific KPIs, keeping our messaging informative and empathetic. It wasn’t about hard selling—it was about helping people feel at ease when thinking about life’s most sensitive moments.</p>

                    <br />

                    <h3>The Results</h3>
                    <br />

                    <p>In just the first month of running this campaign, we saw a <strong>200% increase in digital inquiries</strong>, with nearly <strong>50 quality leads</strong> asking to apply for the memorial plan.</p>

                    <p>This project was meaningful on so many levels. It showed that when you pair the right message with intentional design and strategy, <strong>even the most traditional businesses can thrive in the digital space</strong>—without losing the human touch that makes them special.</p>

                    <p><strong>MB Scalar Travel</strong> had one big goal: to make it easier for people to <strong>discover and book their dream getaways online</strong>.

                    <p>I designed and built a <strong>modern, mobile-friendly website</strong> where users can easily explore travel packages, submit inquiries, and even book trips online. I focused on making the layout intuitive and the flow seamless, so even first-time visitors feel guided, not overwhelmed.

                    <br />

                    <p>To take things a step further, I also helped launch a <strong>dedicated blog section</strong>—featuring travel tips, destination guides, and practical advice that makes trip planning easier and more exciting. I personally onboarded a content writer to make sure the blog was not just active, but genuinely <strong>helpful, informative, and aligned with the brand's voice.</strong></p>

                    <p>This project was a great reminder that great design, helpful content, and smart systems can turn a basic travel site into a powerful booking tool.</p>

                    <p>Next, I designed a user-friendly website that highlights the benefits of the software while making it easy for visitors to take action. Two types of lead forms were integrated: one for users to request a free demo, and another for those ready to start a trial right away.</p>

                    <br />

                    <p>To drive awareness, I also crafted a social media campaign designed to introduce the software and spark conversations with potential clients. Everything—from visuals to captions—was aligned to resonate with Cebuano entrepreneurs.</p>

                    <p>This project was about more than just launching a tool—it was about building trust and making sure local businesses could see how this software could simplify their daily operations. I’m proud to have helped shape IBS Payroll’s digital identity and connect it with the community it was built for.</p>
